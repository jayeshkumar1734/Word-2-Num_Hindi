# Word-2-Num_Hindi
### **IMPORTANT**: 

Since this code was written in collaboration with a company, I cannot put the actual code here, but the results are shown below. If anyone wants to have a discussion on any aspect, I am available for it.

### **PROJECT**

This project tries to convert words to their respective number in digits. Currently there's no work specifically for this which is perfect. But the results of this repository are state of the art and can be used as a top layer to any Automatic Speech Recognition or Natural Language Processing task to enhance their results. 

A massive dictionary was formed for numbers 1-100 to catch all variations of the output of value less than 100,000 and convert it into digits. 
This python file can also show time in numeric format along with showing alpha numeric passwords and bank account in their required format. 
Finally, this repo add punctuation after each line which is highly useful for a conversation.
